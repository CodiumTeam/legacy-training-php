# Weather kata
We cannot control the weather, but we can predict it.

This kata has a code that request the weather prediction from different services.

## Goal
- Test coupled code.
- Remove the external dependency when testing in order to make the tests repeatable and fast
    
## Run the kata
On Linux and Mac

    make

in Windows using docker

    docker run --rm -v ${PWD}:/code codiumteam/legacy-training-php:weather make
